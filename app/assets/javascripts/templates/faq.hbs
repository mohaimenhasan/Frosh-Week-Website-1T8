                    <h2>General Information</h2>
                    <h3>What is F!rosh Week?</h3>
                    <p>
                        F!rosh week is the first week of the academic year at a university, and is accompanied by a
                        wide range of social events are held to help orient and welcome new students.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why should I go?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Simply because F!rosh Week will be the bestest most awesome time you'll have at SKULE! Also
                        it's a great way to make friends right off the bat and get to know the campus!
                    </p>

                    <h3>What's the deal with the exclamation mark in F!rosh?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's to show you how fun it is - the exclamation couldn't even wait until the end of the word.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What’s up with the word Skule&trade;?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pronounced “school”, it’s just our way of spelling it (because engineers can’t spell).

                    <h2>F!rosh Kits and Registration</h2>
                    <h3>What is a F!rosh Kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's both a collection of handy stuff that you should own and your admission to F!rosh Week.
                        It is strongly advised that you purchase one.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Where do I get my F!rosh Kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        You get a F!rosh Kit by registering! Registration info is coming soon!
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is IN a F!rosh Kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We are finalizing this and we will get back to you.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Do I have to buy a F!rosh Kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you want to participate in F!rosh Week, then yes. The profits from the kit allow us to pay
                        for all the crazy stuff you will get to do. It is worth it. Plus it is a memento of your
                        entrance to the greatest university in Canada!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lots of the stuff we have planned for you costs money. We tried growing money, but it hasn't
                        worked out yet. So we conned some retailers into selling us cool stuff at rock bottom prices,
                        and in turn are selling it to you at a marginal profit. Remember that our F!rosh kits are both
                        the biggest and the cheapest on campus.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is the difference between signing up and purchasing a F!rosh kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nothing. By signing up you purchase a F!rosh kit, and by purchasing a F!rosh kit you sign up.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Are there any events can I attend without buying a F!rosh kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes. You can attend faculty events and class on Thursday and Friday. However, we don't think
                        these are much fun.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Is there any financial aid for buying a F!rosh kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes. You can get financial aid by through the F!rosh Week Bursary. For more information email
                        <a href="mailto:bursary@orientation.skule.ca">orientation@skule.ca</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My residence-college also wants me to buy their frosh kit. What should I do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Buy ours, not theirs. It is cheaper, better, and our orientation is the best on campus. Also,
                        I heard your residence-college people say you looked funny! You should get back at them by
                        doing Engineering orientation.

                    <h3>What do I need to bring/wear for F!rosh Week?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wear old clothes. F!rosh Week can get pretty messy. You might want to dye yourself purple
                        without also dyeing everything you're wearing, so wear an old swimsuit or something similar.
                        Also, wear reasonably comfortable shoes and socks, as you'll be doing a lot of walking.
                        Finally, don't forget to dress for the weather, as most of the events are outside. This
                        includes sunblock!

                    <p>
                        Things you should NOT bring are: Large bags, valuable items (iPods, Rolexes, PSPs, laptops
                        etc), lunch (you’ll be fed! But you can bring light snacks if you eat a lot). Remember,
                        you will be walking around ALL DAY and we will NOT be providing storage (plus, you will
                        already be carrying your humongous F!rosh Kit)!

                    <h3>Do I have to go to every event?</h3>
                    <p>
                        No, but you really should. For one thing, most events start where the previous event ended,
                        so if you skipped an event, you might have trouble finding your group. Or all the groups.
                        Also, every event has some purpose. By going to all of them, you'll learn your way around
                        campus, be in the F!rosh picture, see what the fuss is over the purple dye, and generally
                        meet more people and have more fun.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What's up with purple dye?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <!-- TODO(johnliu): traditions page -->
                        You will be encouraged to get yourself dyed purple (in spirit of the engineering tradition!)
                        <!-- See: Traditions)--> It may or may not sting/burn you depending how sensitive your skin is.
                        It will stay on for a couple days (depending on your washing habits!)
                    </p>

                    <h3>What if I get hurt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        There will be members of Skule Patrol at every event and with every group. Skule Patrol
                        members are trained in first aid and will have first aid kits. They can be identified by
                        their snazzy red T-shirts.
