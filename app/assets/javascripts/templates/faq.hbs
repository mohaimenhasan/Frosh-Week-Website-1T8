                    <h3>What is F!rosh Week?</h3>
                    <p>
                        F!rosh week is the first week of the academic year at U of T Engineering, and is accompanied by
                        a wide range of social events that are held to help orient and welcome new students.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why should I go?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Simply because F!rosh Week will be the bestest most awesome time you'll have at Skule&trade;! Also
                        it's a great way to make friends right off the bat and get to know the campus!
                    </p>

                    <h3>What's the deal with the exclamation mark in F!rosh?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's to show you how fun it is - the exclamation couldn't even wait until the end of the word.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What’s up with the word Skule&trade;?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pronounced “school”, it’s just our way of spelling it (because engineers can’t spell).
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is a F!rosh Kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's both a collection of handy stuff that you should own and your admission to F!rosh Week.
                        It is strongly advised that you purchase one.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Where do I get my F!rosh Kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        You get a F!rosh Kit by registering! Register by clicking Register Now at the top of the page.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is IN a F!rosh Kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A ton of cool stuff! You get a hard hat, a clipboard, a free yearbook at the end of the year,
                        and much more!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Do I have to buy a F!rosh Kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you want to participate in F!rosh Week, then yes. The revenues from the kit allow us to pay
                        for all the crazy stuff you will get to do. It is worth it. Plus it is a memento of your
                        entrance to the greatest university in Canada!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lots of the stuff we have planned for you costs money. We tried growing money, but it hasn't
                        worked out yet. So we conned some retailers into selling us cool stuff at rock bottom prices,
                        and in turn are selling it to you. Our F!rosh kits are both the biggest and the cheapest on
                        campus.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is the difference between signing up and purchasing a F!rosh kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nothing. By signing up you purchase a F!rosh kit, and by purchasing a F!rosh kit you sign up.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Are there any events that I can attend without buying a F!rosh kit?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes. You can attend faculty events and class on Thursday and Friday. However, we don't think
                        these are much fun.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My residence-college also wants me to buy their frosh kit. What should I do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Buy ours, not theirs. It is cheaper, better, and our orientation is the best on campus. Also,
                        I heard your residence-college people say you look funny! You should get back at them by doing
                        Engineering orientation.

                        Yes. As long as you let us know what you need from us in the "Accessibility Information" box
                        in the registration form, we will make arrangements to accomodate you. To give us enough time

                    <h2><i class="icon-time"></i> The Week of F!rosh Week</h2>
                    <h3>What do I need to bring/wear for F!rosh Week?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wear old clothes. F!rosh Week can get pretty messy. You might want to dye yourself purple
                        without also dyeing everything you're wearing, so wear an old swimsuit or something similar.
                        Also, wear reasonably comfortable shoes and socks, as you'll be doing a lot of walking.
                        Finally, don't forget to dress for the weather, as most of the events are outside. This
                        includes sunblock!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Also, remember to bring your F!rosh Kit ticket on September 2nd!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Things you should NOT bring are: Large bags, valuable items (iPods, Rolexes, PSPs, laptops
                        etc), lunch (you’ll be fed! But you can bring light snacks if you eat a lot). Remember,
                        you will be walking around ALL DAY and we will NOT be providing storage (plus, you will
                        already be carrying your humongous F!rosh Kit)!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Do I have to go to every event?</h3>
                    <p>
                        No, but you really should. For one thing, most events start where the previous event ended,
                        so if you skipped an event, you might have trouble finding your group. Or all the groups.
                        Also, every event has some purpose. By going to all of them, you'll learn your way around
                        campus, be in the F!rosh picture, see what the fuss is over the purple dye, and generally
                        meet more people and have more fun.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What's up with purple dye?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <!-- TODO(johnliu): traditions page -->
                        You will be encouraged to dye purple (in the spirit of the engineering tradition!)
                        <!-- See: Traditions)--> The process may sting/burn you if you have sensitive skin.
                        It will stay on for a couple days (depending on your washing habits!)
                    </p>

                    <h3>What if I get hurt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        There will be members of Skule Patrol at every event and with every group. Skule Patrol
                        members are trained in first aid and will have first aid kits. They can be identified by
                        their snazzy red T-shirts.
                    </p>

                        Engineering Society, the student government body of the Faculty of Applied Science and
