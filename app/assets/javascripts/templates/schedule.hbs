                                            Campus Tours is the part of F!rosh Week where we get to show all of you the AWESOME and HYPE parts of our campus. We'll bring you from King's College Circle after Matriculation through the engineering buildings to give you all a good introduction to your new home for the next couple of years. We'll also keep it interesting along the way with some PURPLE and HYPE events, and lots of shade to keep it cool in. After lunch and the tours are over, we'll drop you off for your next adventure through Downtown Toronto.

                                            In addition to this tour, you will participate in the time-honoured tradition of getting dyed purple with the rest of your F!rosh group! Dyeing purple is a lot of fun and we totally recommend you try it! That said it is entirely up to you how purple you want to get, if at all. Find out more about this amazing experience and what it will be like by asking your Leedurs, or by seeing our FAQ page from the top and other resources.
