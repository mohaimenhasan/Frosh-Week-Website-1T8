                                            D-Battle is a dance competition that pits students against each other to
                                            see who is the king of dancing at UofT. F!rosh Week 1T4 will again see
                                            students duke it out against each other, popping and locking their way to
                                            victory. Who will rule the dancefloor? Come to Suds to find out! This event
