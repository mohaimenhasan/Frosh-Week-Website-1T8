                                            scavenger hunt. But beware! This is not your average scavenger hunt. From
                                            eating cloves of raw garlic to getting the mayor of Toronto to officially
                                            endorse the Engineering Havenger Scunt, craziness of all sorts have made
                                            the list. You won't believe the things that happen at this event!
