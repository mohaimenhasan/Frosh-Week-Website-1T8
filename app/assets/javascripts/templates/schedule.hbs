                                            Definitely the coolest way to end F!rosh week. This is an overnight camping trip to the legendary Hart House Farm near Caledon (about two hours away from U of T). Bring a sleeping bag and a tent if you have one, or make friends with someone who does when you get there.

                                            Play sports, go swimming, watch a movie, hang out with your friends by a camp-fire, or just enjoy the great outdoors. It's all there at Hart House Farm!

                                            This is a great way to relax before the busy school year starts and and a place where memories are definitely made.
