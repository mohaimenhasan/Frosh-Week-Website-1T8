                                            best spots to study, to the spots you thought you would
                                            study but never really do. 
                                            Also, participate in the time-honoured tradition of getting dyed purple with the rest of your F!rosh group! Will you be brave enough to go full body, or will only a pinky finger suffice? Ask your Leedurs about this awesome event - and don't worry: the dye fades and only really lasts a few days :).
