                                            F!rosh victory! But beware, the quest is fraught with a variety of
                                            challenges to test the skills, courage, and creativity of those F!rosh
                                            brave enough to undertake it. In the end, a lone group shall emerge
                                            victorious, and to the victors go the spoils!

                                            hours away from U of T). Bring a sleeping bag and a tent if you have one,
                                            or make friends with someone who does when you get there. Play sports, go
                                            swimming, watch a movie, hang out with your friends by a camp-fire, or just
                                            enjoy the great outdoors. It's all there at Hart House Farm! This is a
                                            great way to relax before the busy school year starts and and a place where memories are definitely made.

                                            Definitely the coolest way to end F!rosh week, this is an overnight
                                            camping trip to the legendary Hart House Farm near Caledon (about two
                                            hours away from U of T). Bring a sleeping bag and a tent if you have one,
                                            or make friends with someone who does when you get there. Play sports, go
                                            swimming, watch a movie, hang out with your friends by a camp-fire, or just
                                            enjoy the great outdoors. It's all there at Hart House Farm! This is a
                                            great way to relax before the busy school year starts and and a place where memories are definitely made.
